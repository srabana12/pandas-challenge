# Module 4 Challenge


Introduction:
Purpose of the challenge is to analyze the district-wide standardized test results for every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attended to identify any obvious trends.

Analysis Results:

Upon studying the provided data closely we have arrived at the following conclusions:

- Charter schools have higher average math and reading scores, as well as higher passing rates in both subjects and overall, compared to district schools.
- The top 5 highest performing school (by % Overall Passing) are all Charter schools.
- The bottom 5 lowest performing school (by % Overall Passing) are all District type.
- Small and medium-sized schools have higher average math and reading scores, as well as higher passing rates in both subjects and overall, compared to large schools.
- Students across all grades across all the schools have scored higher in reading compared to math on an average.
- There is no clear relationship between school budget and academic performance. For example, Cabrera High School has a lower budget compared to some district schools, yet it has the highest passing rates and average scores.
- There is no clear relationship between per student budget and academic performance. For example, Holden High School has the lowest per student budget, yet it has the highest overall passing rate.


Limitations and Assumptions:
- The Charter schools mostly fall in the range of small - medium while District schools are mostly large meaning more number of students. It would be more accurate to compare school results of similar size.

Recommendations:
- It might provide better insight to see where the school budget is spent for different schools in order to draw accurate relations to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

Conclusion:
- The top 5 highest performing school (by % Overall Passing) are all Charter schools.
- The bottom 5 lowest performing school (by % Overall Passing) are all District type.
- Charter schools have higher average math and reading scores, as well as higher passing rates in both subjects and overall, compared to district schools.
- Students across all grades across all the schools have scored higher in reading compared to math on an average.
